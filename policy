1. Purpose
File Vault is a simple tool designed exclusively for personal and legal file access, sharing, and management through Dropbox. It is intended for private, authorized users only.

2. Data Handling
Uploaded files are stored directly in the linked Dropbox account.

No files are stored on this server or exposed to unauthorized parties.

We do not collect personal data, analytics, or tracking cookies.

Dropbox access tokens are stored locally and securely in a non-public JSON file (dropbox_token.json) and never shared.

3. User Roles

Admin: Can upload, view, and manage files.

Owner: Has full rights, including deleting files and managing access tokens.

All actions are logged internally and are not visible to other users.

4. Legal Use Only
This tool is strictly intended for legal and non-malicious use:

No pirated, illegal, or harmful content may be uploaded or shared.

Violation of these terms may result in immediate and permanent restriction of access.

5. Security
This app does not expose source code (e.g., app.py) to public users.

Dropbox tokens are encrypted and only editable by authorized roles.

6. Changes
We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time without notice. Continued use of File Vault implies agreement with the current version of this policy.
